# Number Guessing Game

This is my own version of a number guessing game.

## How to use

Above the code on the right, there is a green button with "Code" on it, press that and press "Download ZIP". A ZIP file should be downloaded and you can go ahead and right click it and press extract files and a new folder should be created. This folder will contain the solution that you can open with Visual Studio.
